          <p>
            In 2008, a significant moment from my childhood occurred when we got our first family PC, a Pentium Dual
            Core. I was around 4 or 5 years old, and this new piece of technology captivated me. I spent countless hours
            beside my father, watching him work, or with my mother, listening to songs she played from DVDs. Like any
            curious kid, I split my time between playing games and clicking on every option I could find, trying to
            understand how everything worked. I wasn't a prodigy hacking into government systems; I was simply a kid,
            exploring the endless possibilities that the PC offered. As time went on, we moved from the family PC to a
            Sony laptop, but my routine stayed the same – games, exploration, and a bit of digital mischief.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Right from a young age, I was driven by curiosity about how
            things worked. The world seemed like a vast playground of
            mysteries waiting to be unraveled, and I was determined to
            explore every nook and cranny. Passionate about learning, I
            spent countless hours exploring the internet and engaging in
            conversations with anyone willing to share knowledge.
          </p>


          <div class="blockquote my-5" style="background-color: black;">
            <p class="blockquote-text  text-white pl-2">
              “Curiosity is the wick in the candle of learning.”
            </p>
            <span class="blockquote-footer text-white h4 mt-3">William Arthur Ward</span>
          </div>

          <p>
            The most important person in these conversations was my uncle, a web developer. Whenever I had the chance to
            meet him, I would eagerly bombard him with questions. Day or night, weekday or holiday, my curiosity knew no
            bounds, and sometimes he would good-naturedly express a hint of exhaustion from my unending inquiries. Yet,
            his patient explanations and willingness to share his expertise became a cornerstone of my learning journey.
            It was never about grades or academic achievements; it was a hunger for understanding, a relentless pursuit
            of knowledge that fueled my days and nights
          </p>
          <br>

          <p>
            Then came the turning point – a moment that would awaken the engineer within me. Both the laptop and the PC
            stopped working, leaving me with more than just a broken screen. I wanted to understand the inner workings
            of these devices. I discovered a newfound passion for dismantling gadgets, although I quickly realized I
            lacked expertise in this art. None of the gadgets I ever dismantled were reassembled correctly. My curious
            mind craved answers on how to fix and reassemble these complicated pieces properly.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Interestingly,
            while many chose to study computer science formally or because
            of trends, I took a different path. Computer science wasn't a
            subject in the academic sense; it was a realm of fascination
            that I explored independently. I grew not only in knowledge but
            also in the ability to share and collaborate. The hunger for
            learning new things was not a solitary pursuit; it became a
            journey to grow with others. I found like-minded individuals,
            forming a community bound by the shared passion.
